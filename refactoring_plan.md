# Frontend Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the frontend system, focusing on improving organization, maintainability, performance, and eliminating dead code.

## Phase 1: Preparation & Setup

### 1.1 Codebase Analysis (Initial)
*   **Objective:** Gain a deep understanding of the current frontend architecture, identify key areas for refactoring, and pinpoint existing issues.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Review existing documentation (if any).
    *   Analyze the current folder structure and component organization.
    *   Identify large, monolithic components (e.g., `AdminDashboard.js`).
    *   Look for duplicated logic or UI patterns.
    *   Identify potential performance bottlenecks (e.g., large bundle sizes, slow rendering).
    *   Assess current state management patterns.
    *   Review API integration patterns.

### 1.2 Define Goals & Metrics
*   **Objective:** Clearly articulate the desired outcomes of the refactoring and establish measurable metrics for success.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Quantify performance improvements (e.g., reduce initial load time by X%, improve Lighthouse scores).
    *   Set targets for code maintainability (e.g., reduce cyclomatic complexity, increase code readability scores).
    *   Define goals for dead code elimination (e.g., reduce bundle size by Y%).
    *   Establish targets for test coverage.
    *   Define improved developer experience (DX) metrics.

### 1.3 Version Control Strategy
*   **Objective:** Ensure a robust Git branching strategy to manage refactoring tasks safely and efficiently.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Utilize feature branches for each refactoring task.
    *   Regularly rebase/merge with the main branch to avoid large merge conflicts.
    *   Ensure clear commit messages.

### 1.4 Testing Strategy
*   **Objective:** Establish a comprehensive testing approach to ensure the stability and correctness of the refactored codebase.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Identify existing test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end).
    *   Prioritize adding tests for critical paths and complex logic where coverage is lacking.
    *   Ensure tests can be run efficiently and automatically (CI/CD).
    *   Consider snapshot testing for UI components.

### 1.5 Linting & Formatting
*   **Objective:** Enforce consistent code style and identify potential issues early.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Configure ESLint with appropriate rules (e.g., `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`).
    *   Integrate Prettier for automatic code formatting.
    *   Add linting and formatting checks to pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipeline.

### 1.6 Dependency Review
*   **Objective:** Optimize the project's dependencies for size, performance, and maintainability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Audit all `package.json` dependencies.
    *   Remove unused or redundant libraries.
    *   Update outdated dependencies to their latest stable versions.
    *   Consider replacing heavy libraries with lighter alternatives if feasible.

## Phase 2: Core Refactoring - Structural Improvements

### 2.1 Component Granularity
*   **Objective:** Break down large, monolithic components into smaller, single-responsibility components.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Example:** Refactor `AdminDashboard.js` into:
        *   `UserTable.js`
        *   `RestaurantTable.js`
        *   `UserModal.js` (already started)
        *   `RestaurantModal.js`
        *   `ModuleSettingsModal.js`
    *   Ensure each component has a clear purpose and minimal side effects.
    *   Pass data and functions via props.

### 2.2 Folder Structure & Naming Conventions
*   **Objective:** Organize files logically to improve discoverability and maintainability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Adopt a consistent folder structure (e.g., by feature, by domain, or a hybrid approach).
    *   Enforce clear and consistent naming conventions for files, components, variables, and functions.
    *   Group related files together.

### 2.3 State Management Review
*   **Objective:** Optimize state management for clarity, performance, and scalability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Evaluate the current use of React Context and local component state.
    *   Consider introducing or refining a global state management solution (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Recoil) for complex or shared state.
    *   Ensure clear separation between UI state and application state.

### 2.4 API Layer Abstraction
*   **Objective:** Centralize and standardize API interactions.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Move all `axiosInstance` calls from components directly into dedicated service files (e.g., `frontend/src/api/adminService.js`).
    *   Create custom hooks for data fetching (e.g., `useUsers`, `useRestaurants`) using `react-query` or similar.
    *   Implement consistent error handling for API calls.

### 2.5 Custom Hooks
*   **Objective:** Encapsulate and reuse complex logic across components.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Identify repetitive logic (e.g., form handling, data fetching, modal toggling).
    *   Create custom hooks to abstract this logic.
    *   **Example:** `useUserForm`, `useRestaurantForm`, `useModal`.

### 2.6 Routing Optimization
*   **Objective:** Improve the clarity and efficiency of the application's routing.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Review `react-router-dom` usage.
    *   Implement nested routes where appropriate.
    *   Consider route-based code splitting (lazy loading).

## Phase 3: Code Quality & Optimization

### 3.1 Dead Code Elimination
*   **Objective:** Remove unused code to reduce bundle size and improve readability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify unused modules.
    *   Manually review components and utility files for unreferenced functions, variables, or components.
    *   Utilize ESLint rules for unused imports/variables.

### 3.2 Performance Optimization
*   **Objective:** Enhance the application's speed and responsiveness.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Lazy Loading (Code Splitting):** Implement `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for routes and large components.
    *   **Memoization:** Strategically apply `React.memo` to functional components and `useMemo`/`useCallback` to expensive computations and functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Image Optimization:** Compress images, use appropriate formats (WebP), and implement responsive images.
    *   **Virtualization:** Use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` for rendering large lists.
    *   **Minimize Re-renders:** Profile component rendering to identify and fix unnecessary re-renders.

### 3.3 Error Handling
*   **Objective:** Implement consistent and user-friendly error handling.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Centralize error logging.
    *   Implement error boundaries for React components.
    *   Provide meaningful error messages to users.

### 3.4 Accessibility (A11y)
*   **Objective:** Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Follow WCAG guidelines.
    *   Use semantic HTML.
    *   Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus management.
    *   Provide ARIA attributes where necessary.

### 3.5 Internationalization (i18n) Refinement
*   **Objective:** Standardize and optimize the internationalization process.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Review translation key structure and consistency.
    *   Optimize translation loading (e.g., lazy load language files).
    *   Ensure all user-facing strings are translated.

## Phase 4: Verification & Deployment

### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
*   **Objective:** Validate the correctness and stability of the refactored codebase.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Execute all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    *   Address any test failures.
    *   Ensure sufficient test coverage for critical paths.

### 4.2 Linting & Type Checking
*   **Objective:** Maintain code quality and prevent common errors.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Run ESLint and Prettier checks.
    *   (If applicable) Run TypeScript type checks.
    *   Resolve all warnings and errors.

### 4.3 Bundle Analysis
*   **Objective:** Confirm the impact of performance optimizations.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Re-run Webpack Bundle Analyzer to compare bundle sizes before and after refactoring.
    *   Identify any new large dependencies or unused code that might have been missed.

### 4.4 Code Review
*   **Objective:** Ensure code quality, adherence to standards, and knowledge sharing.

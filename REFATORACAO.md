# Debugging e Corre칞칚o de Problemas de Visibilidade do Menu/Cabe칞alho

*   **Problem Description:**
    *   After logging in as `super_admin`, the "superadmin" menu item was not visible.
    *   The header with logged-in user information was missing/incorrect.
    *   The "settings" menu item was not visible.
    *   Compilation errors (`prettier`/`eslint`) were present.

*   **Initial Investigation (Sidebar and Header):**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Menu filtering logic in `Sidebar.js` was incorrect, or `user` object was not correctly populated.
    *   **Action:** Examined `Sidebar.js` and `Header.js`.
    *   **Finding:** `Sidebar.js` was filtering by `item.module` and `allowedModules`, but not by `item.roles`. `menuStructure.js` did not initially contain `roles` property for menu items. `Header.js` relied on `user` object from `useAuth()`.

*   **Attempt 1: Restore Menu Structure and Fix `useAuth` Imports**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Restored `frontend/src/components/Layout/Sidebar.js` and `frontend/src/components/Layout/menuStructure.js` from commit `557395b8d1cbbd5a85532f330b4ccf6e85409167` (which contained a more complete menu structure).
        *   Updated `menuStructure.js` to include `roles` property for all menu items and sub-items, and added "Admin" and "Settings" menu items with appropriate roles.
        *   Corrected `useAuth` import paths in `Sidebar.js` from `../../contexts/AuthContext` to `@/app/providers/contexts/AuthContext`.
        *   Identified and corrected `useAuth` import paths in numerous other files (`frontend/src/pages` and `frontend/src/features` directories) that were using incorrect relative paths (e.g., `../../contexts/AuthContext` or `../../../contexts/AuthContext`) to the correct alias `@/app/providers/contexts/AuthContext`.
    *   **Result:**
        *   Menu structure was restored.
        *   `useAuth` import errors were resolved.
        *   **Problem Persisted:** Menu items (superadmin, settings) and header still not displaying correctly. New compilation errors related to `prettier`/`eslint` appeared.

*   **Attempt 2: Refine Menu Filtering Logic and `AuthContext`**
    *   **Hypothesis:** The `user` object's `role` was not being correctly used for filtering, or `allowedModules` was not dynamic.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Modified `frontend/src/app/providers/contexts/AuthContext.js`:
            *   Changed `allowedPermissions = user.permissions || [];` to `allowedPermissions = user.role?.permissions?.map(p => p.name) || [];` to correctly extract permissions.
            *   Implemented a dynamic `getModulesFromUser` function that returns modules based on `user.role.name` (`super_admin`, `admin`, `owner`, `manager`, `waiter`).
        *   Modified `frontend/src/components/Layout/Sidebar.js`:
            *   Updated the menu filtering logic to use `user?.role?.name` for role-based filtering, ensuring both module and role matching.
    *   **Result:**
        *   Improved role and module-based filtering.
        *   **Problem Persisted:** Menu items and header still not displaying correctly. New compilation errors related to `prettier`/`eslint` appeared.

*   **Attempt 3: Address Prettier/ESLint Compilation Errors**
    *   **Hypothesis:** The compilation errors were preventing the application from running correctly, masking the true state of the UI.
    *   **Action:** Systematically addressed `prettier`/`eslint` errors reported in `error.log` for `AuthContext.js` and `Sidebar.js`.
        *   **`AuthContext.js`:** Renamed `module` parameter to `mod` in `allModules.filter` to resolve `prettier/prettier` error.
        *   **`Sidebar.js`:**
            *   Corrected import formatting for `ExpandLess`, `ExpandMore`, `ChevronRight`.
            *   Adjusted formatting for `Paper` component's `sx` prop.
            *   Refactored complex ternary operator in `ListItemButton` for better readability (as per `prettier`'s suggestion).
            *   Corrected `ListItemText` formatting.
            *   Corrected `setOpenMobileMenus` state update formatting.
            *   Corrected `Submenu` component formatting.
    *   **Result:**
        *   All reported `prettier`/`eslint` compilation errors were resolved.
        *   **Problem Persisted:** User reports that the issues with the menu and header are still present.

*   **Current Status:**
    *   The application compiles without `prettier`/`eslint` errors.
    *   The menu structure is restored.
    *   `useAuth` imports are correct.
    *   Menu filtering logic in `Sidebar.js` is updated to consider both modules and roles.
    *   `AuthContext.js` is updated to dynamically assign modules and correctly extract permissions based on user roles.
    *   The core problem of the "superadmin" menu item, header user info, and "settings" menu item not appearing correctly still persists, indicating a deeper issue not yet identified.
